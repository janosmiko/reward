# Reward

Reward is the remixed/remastered version of Warden project, completely rewritten in Golang. It is a Swiss Army knife
CLI utility for orchestrating Docker based development environments. It makes possible to run multiple
local environments simultaneously without port conflicts by utilizing a few common services proxying
requests into the correct environment's containers.

Reward supports Linux, macOS and Windows.

Reward was created under the aegis of ITG Commerce.
