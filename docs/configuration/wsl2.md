## WSL and WSL2 Support

On Windows, by default, Reward uses file synchronization method with Mutagen instead of direct mounting.
It is possible to enable direct mounting for WSL2. WSL2 provides better performance for Filesystem mounts if they are in the WSL filesystem.

Under the hood Windows runs a lightweight Virtual Machine and using Bash for Ubuntu for Windows you will get your root from this filesystem.
If you choose to develop from under this filesystem you will get really great performance for your mounts.

The caveat is you'll have to reach this filesystem somehow from your IDE.

``` warning::
    It's pretty important to understand in this case the files you are reaching from WSL2 are inside a Virtual Machine.

    That's the reason why they are blazing fast in docker, because they can be directly mounted to docker just as on a Linux machine.
```

Visual Studio Code offers a WSL2 extension for this problem.

### Enable WSL 2 on Windows 10

1. To install WSL2, enable WSL and VirtualMachinePlatform Windows features in an elevated Powershell prompt

    ``` powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    ```

2. Then install the new version of Microsoft's Linux kernel

    [WSL Update](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)

3. Change default WSL version of the system to WSL2
    ``` powershell
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```

4. Install the preferred Linux Distribution from Microsoft Store

5. Check WSL versions of the distros on the system

    ``` powershell
    wsl --list --version
    ```

6. Convert distributions to WSL 2

    ``` powershell
    wsl --set-version <distribution name> <versionNumber>

    <# example: #>
    wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
    ```

``` warning::
    **Beware of your Distro's package managers!**
    Please make sure you are using Windows' Docker's WSL integration.

    **You should not install Docker with Ubuntu's package manager inside your Bash for Ubuntu for Windows!**
```

### Enabling WSL2 Direct Mount in Reward

To enable WSL2 support in Reward you can use `--wsl2-direct-mount` command line flag or to make it persistent, you can
enable the following setting in your reward config `~/.reward.yml`.

```
reward_wsl2_direct_mount: 1
```

``` warning::
    You should only use this for directories which are inside your WSL2 filesystem or mounted to WSL2 filesystem.
```

``` note::
    If you encounter the following error:

    .. code::

        Cannot create container for service php-fpm:
        failed with: can't access specified distro mount service:
        stat /run/guest-services/distro-services/ubuntu.sock: no such file or directory

    Possible Solution: check your Windows Docker Settings and under the Resources -> WSL INTEGRATION tab
    and make sure docker integration is enabled for the distro you are using.
```

### Reward config file overlapping in WSL/Windows

``` note::
    Even when you are running Reward's Windows binary inside WSL2 it will not use WSL2's home directory as your user's and the application's HOME.
    That's because of GO's behaviour on determining the User's HOME. On Windows it will still be your Windows User's HOME directory.

    To change Reward's default config file you can use the ``--config`` flag.

    Similarly Composer's home directory (~/.composer) will be mounted from Windows User's home directory.

    To change it you can add ``reward_composer_dir`` variable to your Reward configuration and set a value from WSL's filesystem.
```
