## FAQ

* Can I use on Windows?

  * Yes, Reward is cross-platform. It was written in Golang with intention to support Windows users as well.

* Should I run reward as **root** user or with sudo?

  * Nope, you should almost never use reward as root user or with sudo. The only exception is running
    the `reward self-update` command/

* Is Reward free?

  * Yes, and it's open source as well.

### Frequent errors

* `docker is not running or docker version is too old`

    If you are sure Docker is running on your system and you keep getting this error, you should check the following:

    * Docker version meets the system requirements mentioned in the
     [Common Requirements](installation.html#common-requirements) section.

    * Your user is not in the `docker` group and it cannot reach Docker's socket.
        * You can check your users groups with `id` command
        * Also if you just installed docker and you just added your user to the docker group you will have to log out
          and log in. For more info go to
          [Install Docker Engine in Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)
          and see the `If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user` section.

* `Error: exit status x`

    Most of the cases these errors are coming from the container or docker itself. Reward tries to run a command inside
    the container, and the exit code of the command is not 0, or the container exited during the execution.
    In most cases this error code will be a part of a longer error message which will describe the problem.


* `Error: exit status 137`

    During Magento 2 installation (`reward bootstrap`) you will get this error code most likely during
    the `composer install` command. Composer installation needs a huge amount of memory and this error code
    represents a docker `out of memory` error code.

    To solve this problem, you will have to increase the memory limit of Docker Desktop. For more info see:
