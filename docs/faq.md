## FAQ

* Can I use on Windows?

  * Yes, Reward is cross-platform. It was written in Golang with intention to support Windows users as well.

* Should I run reward as **root** user or with sudo?

  * Nope, you should almost never use reward as root user or with sudo. The only exception is running
    the `reward self-update` command.

* Is Reward free?

  * Yes, and it's open source as well.

### Frequent errors

* `docker api is unreachable`

    If you are sure Docker is running on your system, and you keep getting this error, you should check the following:

    * **Make sure your Docker version is up to date** and meets the system requirements mentioned in the
     [Common Requirements](installation.html#common-requirements) section.
    ``` ...note::
           Package managers provide outdated Docker versions.
    ```
  
    * **Your user is not in the `docker` group**, or it cannot reach the docker socket.
        * After you add your user to the docker group ***you will have to
          reboot*** (or log out and log back in). For more info go to the following link:
          [Install Docker Engine in Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)
          See the `If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user` section.

    ``` ...note::
           You can check if your user is in the docker group with **id** command.
  
           You can make sure your user is able to reach the docker API running **docker ps** (without sudo).
    ```

* `Error: exit status x`

    Most of the cases these errors are coming from the container or docker itself. Reward tries to run a command inside
    the container, and the exit code of the command is not 0, or the container exited during the execution.
    In most cases this error code will be a part of a longer error message which will describe the problem.


* `Error: exit status 137`

    During Magento 2 installation (`reward bootstrap`) you will get this error code most likely during
    the `composer install` command. Composer installation needs a huge amount of memory and this error code
    represents a docker `out of memory` error code.

    To solve this problem, you will have to increase the memory limit of Docker Desktop. For more info see:
